# Feature Specification: Chat Message Flow Error Resolution

**Feature Branch**: `002-a-better-plan`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a better plan for fixing this error"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Error: TypeError at Chat.svelte:1804 during prompt submission
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: User, Chat component, Message flow system
   ‚Üí Actions: Prompt submission, Message creation, Parent-child linking
   ‚Üí Data: Message history, Response messages, Parent IDs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain message integrity during async operations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Root cause of undefined responseMessage needs investigation
   ‚Üí Deep copy timing issues in message history management
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Enter prompt ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Render response
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement addresses specific failure points in message flow
6. Identify Key Entities (Message, History, Response flow)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec addresses all critical error scenarios
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (reliable chat message submission)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (specific code patterns will be in implementation)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders and developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user enters a prompt in the chat interface and expects the system to process it reliably, whether for regular conversation or artifact creation. The message flow must maintain proper parent-child relationships throughout the async submission process without throwing TypeErrors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user enters a regular text prompt, **When** user submits via Enter key, **Then** message is processed without TypeError and response appears in chat
2. **Given** user enters an artifact creation prompt (e.g., "create a React component"), **When** system detects artifact intent and enhances prompt, **Then** enhanced prompt is submitted successfully and artifact is generated
3. **Given** user has an existing conversation history, **When** user submits a follow-up prompt, **Then** new message maintains proper parent-child relationship with previous messages
4. **Given** multiple models are selected, **When** user submits prompt, **Then** response messages are created for each model without undefined reference errors
5. **Given** system performs deep copy of message history, **When** async operations access message data, **Then** all message references remain valid throughout the process

### Edge Cases
- What happens when responseMessage becomes undefined during async processing?
- How does system handle race conditions between message creation and deep copy operations?
- What occurs when parent-child relationships are corrupted during submission flow?
- How does system recover from TypeError without losing user's prompt?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain valid message references throughout entire prompt submission workflow
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent TypeError when accessing responseMessage.parentId in sendMessageSocket function
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve message history integrity during deep copy operations (JSON.parse(JSON.stringify))
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle both artifact creation and regular prompting flows without reference errors
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide error recovery mechanism when message flow encounters undefined references
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate message existence before accessing nested properties (parentId, childrenIds)
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure responseMessage is properly created and stored in history before sendMessageSocket execution
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain synchronization between message creation in sendMessage and access in sendMessageSocket
- **FR-009**: System MUST log detailed error context when message reference failures occur for debugging
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle cases where message history becomes corrupted during async operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Message**: Core chat message entity with id, parentId, childrenIds, role, content, and metadata properties
- **History**: Message history container with messages object (keyed by ID) and currentId pointer for navigation
- **ResponseMessage**: Assistant message entity created during sendMessage flow, must exist before sendMessageSocket access
- **UserMessage**: User input message that triggers the response generation workflow
- **MessageFlow**: The complete async workflow from prompt submission through response generation and rendering

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (reliable chat functionality)
