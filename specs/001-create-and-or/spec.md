# Feature Specification: Enhanced Artifact Creation and Preview System

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-and-or`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create and/or update the feature that supports the artifact creation and preview features in this code base using the intent classifier to determine whether to enhance a prompt or not, enhance the prompt to ensure the LLM returns output compliant with the PAS 3.0 XML schema documented in the docs directory, parses the CDATA for the artifact code inside and creates an artifact button in the chat window, which opens the artifact preview using sandpack.  If a code block generates TSX code as a side effect, the preview button should open the artifact preview window with that code. we needs end to end automated tests that actually send prompts to an LLM and processes the output, using playwright to ensure that a  persistent bug that prevents artifacts from every displaying due to a retry loop is fixed."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description contains multiple components: intent classification, prompt enhancement, PAS 3.0 compliance, artifact parsing, UI integration, and E2E testing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users, LLM, Intent Classifier, Artifact Parser, Chat Interface, Preview System, Test Framework
   ‚Üí Actions: Classify intent, enhance prompts, parse artifacts, display buttons, render previews, execute tests
   ‚Üí Data: Prompts, PAS 3.0 XML, CDATA content, TSX code, artifact metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: PAS 3.0 schema compliance, retry loop bug fix, end-to-end testing coverage
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Intent classification triggers on explicit "artifact" or "preview" keywords
   ‚Üí Persistent bug is Sandpack renderer stuck in infinite loading state
   ‚Üí E2E testing uses production OpenAI/Claude endpoints with test API keys
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User sends prompt ‚Üí Intent classified ‚Üí Enhanced if needed ‚Üí LLM responds ‚Üí Artifacts parsed ‚Üí Preview rendered
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement covers intent classification, prompt enhancement, artifact parsing, UI rendering, and testing
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Intent Classifier, Prompt Enhancer, Artifact Parser, Preview Renderer, Test Suite
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some clarifications needed for specific implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: What specific criteria should the intent classifier use to determine when prompt enhancement is needed? ‚Üí A: User explicitly requests "artifact" or "preview"
- Q: What constitutes the "persistent bug" in the retry loop that prevents artifacts from displaying? ‚Üí A: Sandpack renderer gets stuck in infinite loading state
- Q: What is the acceptable response time for intent classification? ‚Üí A: 5 seconds
- Q: Which LLM endpoints should be used for E2E testing? ‚Üí A: Production OpenAI/Claude endpoints with test API keys
- Q: What should happen when Sandpack fails to load or render code? ‚Üí A: Show error with retry button for user

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users interact with a chat interface where they can request code generation or UI components. The system intelligently detects when a user's prompt would benefit from enhancement to generate structured artifacts, processes the enhanced prompts through an LLM, extracts compliant PAS 3.0 XML artifacts from responses, and provides interactive preview buttons that render the code using Sandpack. The system ensures reliability through comprehensive end-to-end testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user types a prompt requesting a React component, **When** the intent classifier determines enhancement is needed, **Then** the prompt is enhanced to request PAS 3.0 compliant output and the LLM response contains parseable artifacts
2. **Given** an LLM response contains PAS 3.0 XML with CDATA containing TSX code, **When** the response is processed, **Then** an artifact preview button appears in the chat interface
3. **Given** a user clicks an artifact preview button, **When** the preview opens, **Then** the Sandpack renderer displays the interactive component with the parsed TSX code
4. **Given** an LLM response contains regular code blocks with TSX content, **When** the response is processed, **Then** a preview button is also available to render that code in the artifact preview
5. **Given** the E2E test suite runs, **When** it sends actual prompts to LLMs and processes responses, **Then** artifacts are successfully created and rendered without retry loops

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the LLM returns malformed PAS 3.0 XML?
- How does the system handle artifacts with missing dependencies?
- What occurs when the intent classifier fails to determine enhancement necessity?
- How are retry loops detected and prevented during artifact rendering?
- When Sandpack fails to load or render code, system displays error message with retry button for user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST classify user intent by detecting explicit requests for "artifact" or "preview" keywords to determine when prompt enhancement is needed
- **FR-002**: System MUST enhance prompts when appropriate to ensure LLM responses comply with PAS 3.0 XML schema as documented in the docs directory
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse PAS 3.0 XML responses and extract CDATA content containing artifact code
- **FR-004**: System MUST display artifact preview buttons in the chat interface when valid artifacts are detected in responses
- **FR-005**: System MUST render artifact previews using Sandpack when users click preview buttons
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect TSX code blocks in LLM responses and provide preview functionality even when not in formal PAS 3.0 format
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent Sandpack renderer from getting stuck in infinite loading state that prevents artifacts from displaying
- **FR-008**: System MUST include comprehensive E2E test suite that sends actual prompts to production OpenAI/Claude endpoints with test API keys and validates complete artifact workflow
- **FR-009**: E2E tests MUST use Playwright to simulate real user interactions with the chat interface and artifact previews
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate all parsed artifacts against PAS 3.0 schema before rendering
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle both formal PAS 3.0 XML artifacts and informal TSX code blocks equivalently in the preview system
- **FR-012**: System MUST show error message with retry button when Sandpack fails to load or render code

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Intent classification MUST complete within 5 seconds
- **NFR-002**: Artifact parsing and rendering MUST not block the chat interface
- **NFR-003**: E2E tests MUST run reliably in CI/CD pipeline without flaky failures

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Intent Classifier**: Analyzes user prompts to determine if enhancement for artifact generation would be beneficial, maintains classification criteria and confidence thresholds
- **Prompt Enhancer**: Modifies user prompts to include PAS 3.0 compliance instructions and artifact generation guidance
- **Artifact Parser**: Extracts and validates PAS 3.0 XML from LLM responses, parses CDATA content, handles both formal artifacts and code blocks
- **Preview Button Component**: UI element that appears in chat when artifacts are detected, triggers preview rendering
- **Sandpack Renderer**: Renders interactive code previews using Sandpack, handles TSX/React components and other supported formats
- **Retry Loop Monitor**: Detects and prevents infinite retry conditions during artifact processing and rendering
- **E2E Test Framework**: Playwright-based testing system that validates complete artifact workflow from prompt to preview
