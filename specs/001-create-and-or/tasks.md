# Tasks: Enhanced Artifact Creation and Preview System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-and-or/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
✅ 1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.x, Svelte 4.x, SvelteKit, Sandpack, OpenAI/Claude APIs
   → Structure: Web application - SvelteKit frontend with FastAPI backend
✅ 2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 15+ entities including Advanced Dependency Resolution System
   → contracts/: 6 contract files (dependency-resolver, enhanced-error-recovery, etc.)
   → research.md: 4-tier strategy system, LLM integration decisions
✅ 3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Advanced Dependency Resolution System structure
   → Tests: contract tests, validation tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   → Core: dependency resolver, strategies, UI components, LLM integration
   → Validation: comprehensive test coverage for all requirements
   → Integration: ArtifactRenderer integration, circuit breaker
   → Polish: performance, edge cases, user experience validation
✅ 4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Focus on Advanced Dependency Resolution System validation
✅ 5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
✅ 6. Generate dependency graph with validation focus
✅ 7. Create parallel execution examples for comprehensive validation
✅ 8. Focus on Advanced Artifact Dependency Resolution System implementation
✅ 9. Return: SUCCESS (50 tasks ready for execution with comprehensive validation)
```
